# To-Do List Developer Tests
Solution of a simple To-Do list developer test in number of client side web platforms.


## The Test
The test is part of a Front-End Developer Interview Task. The interviewee is given 2 hours to write a program that meets the following requirements.

### Task
Using a JavaScript or TypeScript-based framework, create a web application that allows a user to create a TODO list

#### Task Details

#### Customer Acceptance Criteria:
- The user should be able to create a TODO list
- The user should be able to add tasks to the TODO list
- The user should be able to remove tasks from the TODO list
- The user should be able to re-order the tasks in the TODO list
- The application should be presented on screen with some effort given to intuitive design and usability

A note on data – Normally data would be stored in a database and accessed via an API. This is not the case for this task. Instead, data should be ‘stored’ client-side. Feel free to mimic/stub how the application would make calls to an API although this is not necessary.
